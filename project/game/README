-The game rules are simple:
    - Each player pays some money and plays one game round.
    - Each round consists of some questions with increasing difficulty (some easy, some medium, some hard)
    - Each player has some seconds of time to answer the questions
    - The first wrong or out of time answer terminates the game and the player loses.
    - If the page of a game is refreshed the player loses.
    - If a player wins the game, they are rewarded with all the money invested in the game by all players until now.
    - If a player wins the game then they have the option to destroy this meaningless game.

-The initial values of cost, difficulty and time limit are defined in the Game class. I have set some example default values.

-The whole idea is based on sessions. The session key of a player is the identifier of who they are and what they have done.

-I kept things simple and did not use login or any other credentials to identify players. In real world we would need
emails, passwords and strong credentials. My universe is much simpler.

-A player can not see previously seen question using the same session key. They can see questions they have seen before 
using different session keys (i.e. anonymous tab), but they should play a lot to beat the game this way.

-The purpose of this game is fun, not profit, otherwise I would reward players with 
    10 * the cost of each round,
to ensure most players won't beat the game by just changing sessions and printscreen the questions to google the answers, 
and gradually lower the multiplier based on how many times they have already won.
