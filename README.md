-This project is built on python 3.11.10 and commands for Ubuntu OS. 

-For a complete build run the following command in the directory of your choice. It pulls the project and builds it one-take:
    make build_app

- I have included docker files for a quick build, too.

- You will find useful tasks in Makefile with descriptions of what each task does, in comments.

- I have included .pgpass and sudo commands in Makefile to make it easier to setup, they shouldn't be included in production repo.

- To sync local settings use:
    make sync_local

- In the files of apps there are several detailed comments that should be helpful when diving deeper to the code.

- The increased complexity of import_data.py is explained in the file's comments, along with several details on 
    how and why things were done this way.

-I decided to increase complexity of the task by designing a simple game, conceptually related to the task, 
to demonstrate some more features of django and web development that I am familiar with.

-You will find instructions on how to play the game in the project/game/README file.
